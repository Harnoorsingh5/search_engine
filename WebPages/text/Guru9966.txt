After that, it applies optimizations to the machine code from that acquired knowledge. When this process is completed, scripts run quite fast. What can in-browser JavaScript do? JavaScript's functionality depends on the environment it's running in. For example, Node.js supports functions which allows JavaScript to read and write arbitrary files, perform network requests, object-oriented, etc. The roles that JavaScript plays in both client-side (front end) and server-side (back end) development of applications can vary wildly.

Many browsers allow it to work with files, but the access is very limited and only provided if the user is performing a specific action like, dropping a file into a browser window or selecting using <input> tag. JavaScript allows you to communicate over the net to the server where the current page came from. Although, it does not allow you to receive data from other sites/domains.

However, some modern tool like a Coffee script, Typescript, and Dart allowing developers to code in another language and then auto-convert into the JavaScript code. Where is JavaScript Today?
