Web service is a standardized medium to propagate communication between the client and server applications on the World Wide Web. Web services provide a common platform that allows multiple applications built on various programming languages to have the ability to communicate with each other Popular Web Services Protocols are: SOAP: SOAP is known as the Simple Object Access Protocol. SOAP was developed as an intermediate language so that applications built on various programming languages could talk quickly to each other and avoid the extreme development effort. WSDL: WSDL is known as the Web Services Description Language(WSDL). WSDL is an XML-based file which tells the client application what the web service does and gives all the information required to connect to the web service. REST: REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. REST is used to build Web services that are lightweight, maintainable, and scalable.   Trending Course Top Tutorials About About Us Advertise with Us Write For Us Contact Us Career Suggestion SAP Career Suggestion Tool Software Testing as a Career Selenium Testing Hacking Interesting eBook Blog Quiz SAP eBook SAP Java Python Execute online Execute Java Online Execute Javascript Execute HTML Execute Python Jmeter Informatica JIRA © Copyright - Guru99 2020         Privacy Policy  |  Affiliate Disclaimer  |  ToS
