Architecture of Qlik view The Qlik view architecture comprises of three main components, namely QlikView Server Qlik View Publisher QlikView Desktop. All these components collectively help in designing, developing, and implement the QlikView application. Let's learn all these components in detail: Architecture diagram QlikView QlikView Desktop The QlikView Desktop is a Windows-based development tool. It is used by developers to use to create QlikView data model and GUI layout for application to use at frontend. The developer prepares data for user to use in the desktop environment. They manipulate the data set using SQL like scripting. Developers using code script, linkages/association between data fields and value can be established. The data can also be transformed. The files prepared using the Qlick view desktop can be used and shared in another QlikView application. QlikView Server (QVS) Applications created in the desktop version are hosted on Qlik View Server (QVS) so that user can access and use them anywhere. A QlikView server maintains communication between client/end users. Qlikview server is supported by a powerful QLX engine which provides efficient in-memory data analysis, Data management, distribution, consolidation, scaling, and data access. It is the QVS server which provides data file from the backend to frontend users. QlikView Publisher The QlikView Publisher is an optional mobile for the QlikView server-side component. This component allows you to fetch data from a data source like standard data files, Salesforce, and load data directly into QlikView files. It allows you to conduct data distribution through scheduling and administering tasks. Qlik View Publisher also helps you to reduce unnecessary data load and traffic by efficient distribution. QlikView Management Console Qlick view management console is a platform that centrally manages all the other QlikView components. It is a web-based interface and a server-side app controlled by IT professionals. QlikView User Access QlikView User Access allows customers to access and manipulate data files. The access points for the user are mostly web browsers which can open using desktop, mobile, laptops, etc. Therefore, when the user opens a document in Qlickview and requests to load a data file, the file fetch by the service from the backend is always in the original format. However, the QlikView document made using that file is still in .qvw extension.
