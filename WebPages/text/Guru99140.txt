It can be managed using Microsoft Intune. You can use this tool to view reports and dashboards on the Power Bl Service Report Server. Data sources for the Power BI Data source Description Excel (.xlsx, xlxm) A workbook can have data entered manually or data, which is queried and loaded from external data sources. Comma Separated Value (.csv) Files are simple text files with rows of data. Every row can contain one or more values, which is separated by a comma. Power BI Desktop (.pbi) You can use Power BI Desktop to query and load data from external data sources. Databases in the Cloud It allows you to connect live to Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Data Warehouse, etc. Databases on-premises You can connect directly to SQL Server Analysis Services Relational model databases. A Power BI Enterprise Gateway is required. Key terms used in Power BI Term Description Visualization A visual display of information to achieve one or more objective. It offers a single-screen display of information. It alerts users on issues or problems Operational, Performance, Personal, etc. Datasets A dataset is something which you import or connect to. Datasets can be renamed, refreshed, removes, and explored. Dashboard The dashboard is a collection which contains zero or more tiles and widgets. It is used to represent a customized view of some subset of the underlying datasets. Reports A Power BI report is one or multiple pages of visualizations. It can be created from scratch, imported to a dashboard, and created using datasets. Tile It a single visualization found in a report or on a rectangular dashboard box which contains each visual. History of Power BI Power BI was conceptualized by Ruler and Dhers Netz of the SQL server coverage services team at Microsoft. It was designed by West Chadic George in the year 2010 and named as a Project Crescent. In 2011, It was bundled with SQL Server Codenamed Mount McKinley. Microsoft unveiled the first preview to Power BI in September 2014. The first version of Power BI released on 24 July 2015. It was based on Excel Based Add-ins like Power Query, Pivot, view, and Map. Architecture of Power BI Data Integration: An organization needs to work with data which comes from different sources which can be in various file formats. The data should be extracted from a different source which can be from different servers or databases. This data is integrated into one standard format in a common staging area. Data Processing: In this stage, the integrated data is still not prepared for visualization as the data needs processing. This data is pre-processed. For example, redundant values, missing values will be removed from the data set. The business rule should be applied to the data when the data is cleaned. You can load that data back to Data Warehouse. Data Presentation Once the data is loaded and processed, it can be visualized much better with use of various visualization that Power Bi has to offer. Use of dashboard and report helps one represent data more intuitively. This visual report helps business end users to take business decision based on the insights. Install and run Power BI Desktop Step 1) Visit https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/ And select Download free button Step 2) You will be redirected to a Microsoft store and select Get button. Step 3) Click on the Install button. Step 4) You can see progress status on the screen. Step 5) Before welcome screen you will ask to register to enter. Step 6) When you run Power BI Desktop, a Welcome screen is displayed. Power BI Dashboard Power Bl Desktop is an enlargement tool used to generate dashboards and reports. Power Bl applications will be accessed by other users through desktop and mobile devices. There are Power BI components are 5 main components released in the market. Power Query: It can be used to search, access, and transform public and/ or internal data sources. Power Pivot: It is used for data modeling for in-memory analytics. Power View: This component allows you to visualize, analyze, and display data. Power Map: It brings data to life with interactive geographical visualization. Power BI Service: It allows you to share data views and workbooks, which you can refresh from on-premises and cloud-based data sources. Power BI Q&A: It allows you to ask questions and get immediate answers using a natural language query. Data Management Gateway: It offers periodic data refreshers, view data feeds, expose tables. Data Catalog: This component allows the user to discover and reuse queries using the Data Catalog. Metadata can be facilitated for search functionality. What is Dax Function? DAX is a formula expression language which is called (DAX) which can be used with various visualization tools like Power BI. It is also known as a functional language, where the full code is kept inside a function. DAX programming formulas contain two data types: Numeric and Other. Each is linked to the other by having common columns. Here is a simple diagram showing the relationships. There are 3 things in Power BI where you can use DAX – Calculated Columns Measures Tables Let see all these all of them see how DAX functions works. Calculated Columns Calculated column allows you to create new columns based on the given data. For example, there is no ' Final price' column available in the Items table. Here, the DAX function is used to calculate a new column when only total price & quantity are available. Price = List_Items[MRP]*List_Items[Qty] In the data, each row will now have the respective calculated price. Measures You can perform a calculation using measure without the need to add any data. This is very helpful for reports where the price can be displayed, without requiring an entirely new column to store it. Example: 1] Total of the MRP column * Total of Qty column Tables DAX functions in tabular model return entire tables. For example, In order to generate a list of all the country the organization has clients in, use the function: cities touched = DISTINCT(Customers[City]) A word on Filters Filters hide rows that don't fit given criteria. A calculation after filtering out data will be applicable only on a row which matches those criteria. Power BI DAX Functions Some Important DAX functions are: Average This DAX function allows you to find the average from a given set of values. Example - AvgComm = AVERAGE(List_Items[Price]) Max Helps you to find the maximum from a given set of values. Example – Find out the highest order. HighSale = MAX(List_Items[Price]) Min Helps you to find the minimum set of values. Example – Allows you to find out the lowest order. LowestSale = MIN(List_Items[Price]) Count Count any umerical data. Example – Count number of ticket issued. TicketVolume = COUNT(Invoices[Ticket]) Concatenate This function helps you to join values in calculated columns. You can use ConcatenateX if using in measures. Example – Concatenate the Item names, and MRPs will give a unique code for all the price points at which each product is sold. ProMrp = CONCATENATE(List_Items[Item],List_Items[MRP]) TotalYTD The function allows you to calculate the sum from the start of the current Year to the specified date. It performs calculate base on a calendar year, not a financial year. Example – Calculate Sales totals for the price column. CumiSales = TOTALYTD(SUM(List_Items[Price]),Invoices[Date]) All Returns everything. Ignores filters. Example – Used with the calculate function above. PowerBI vs. Tableau Parameters Power BI Tableau Year of establishment 2013 2003 Application Complete Dashboards for analysis Allow Ad Hoc Analysis Use by Technical or Non Technical users Only use by Analysts Support Very limited Full support Scalability Good Excellent Infrastructure SaaS Flexible Who uses Power BI? Here, are an important professional who uses Power BI tool: PMO - Project and Portfolio Manager Business & Data Analyst Developer & Database Administrator IT Team, IT Professional Consumer for End User Report Data Scientist Disadvantages of Power BI Here, are Cons/drawbacks of using Power BI are: Dashboards and reports only shared with users having the same email domains. Power Bl will not mix imported data, which is accessed from real-time connections. Power Bi will not accept the file larger than 250MB and zip file which compressed by the data of X-velocity in-memory database. Power BI can't accept file size larger than 1 GB. Dashboards never accept or pass user, account, or other entity parameters. Very few data sources that permit real-time connections to Power BI reports and dashboard.
