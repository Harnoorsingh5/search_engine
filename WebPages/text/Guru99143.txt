Today many companies are using Hadoop for cost saving and performance improvement. Often companies using expensive compute time with the enterprise solutions. With Hadoop, data can be transformed cleansed and enriched and integrated for the higher analytical workload. The Talend Sandbox includes four use cases Data Warehouse Optimization Clickstream Analytics Social Media Sentiment Analysis Apache weblog analytics. You can create your own complex Use Cases. Benefits Talend for Big data Hadoop Improve the efficiency of the big data job design by arranging and configuring in a graphical interface. Adds data quality, scalability, and management functions MapReduce feature allows faster parallel data processing Shared Repository and remote deployment Data quality and profiling with Data Cleansing Improves efficiency of big data job design with GUI interface Native support for HBase, HDFS, Hive, Sqoop, Mahout, & Pig Embedded in Hortonworks Data Platform Data Integration: Talend data integration software tool has an open, scalable architecture. It allows faster response to business requests. The tool offers to develop and deploy data integration jobs faster than hand coding. It allows you to easily integrate all your data with other data warehouses or synchronize data between systems. Data integration involves combining data stored in different sources and providing users with a unified view of these data. It helps you to manage various ETL jobs, and empower users with simple, self-service data preparation. Benefits Talend for Data Integration Agile Integration: Respond faster to business requests without writing code using over 1000 out-of-the-box connectors, Eclipse-based graphical tools, and an optimized-for-performance code generator. Team Productivity: Collaborate using powerful versioning, impact analysis, testing and debugging, and metadata management. Easy management: The tool offers advanced scheduling and monitoring features. It provides real-time data integration with dashboards and centralized control for fast deployment across multiple nodes. Stay ahead in the competition: If you use this tool, you will not have to wait for using the latest and coolest data integration features.
